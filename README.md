# Welcome

I am currently a Master candidate at Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University(THUEE). Also I am a Research Intern at Key Lab of Speech Acoustics and Content Understanding, Institute of Acoustics(IOA), Chinese Academy of Sciences(CAS).

My research focuses on Artificial Neural Networks (especially recurrent neural networks) and Deep Learning , as well as their applications to Acoustic Modeling for Large Vocabulary Continuous Speech Recognition (LVCSR).
